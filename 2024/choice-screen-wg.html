        <h2>Motivation and Background</h2>
        <p>
          The power of defaults is a well-established force that shapes people's behavior: few users change 
          default settings, their default browser, or their default search engine. In turn, these defaults
          shape the web at a structural level because they have a powerful influence over which browsers
          and which search engines people use.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because defaults can be selected to favor the interests of the company that sets them rather than 
          those of the user, a number of jurisdictions as well as some user-centric companies, are replacing
          defaults with choice screens. A choice screen is a dialog that prompts the user to make a deliberate
          decision as to which default should be applied. Ideally, this prompt happens rarely (perhaps only
          once) so as not to overwhelm people with constant decisions but it presents a good occasion to
          empower people to choose the option that best matches their preferences.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, experience shows that it is easy to produce a badly designed choice screen such that 
          it will create other problems (e.g. favoring the richest company or the one that most readily sells
          personal data). As the number of jurisdictions in which choice screens are mandated grows (for browsers,
          search, or both), it becomes increasingly important to align on a recommended approach to 
          choice screens.
        </p>
        <p>
          Two facts are important. First, the web community now has real-world pragmatic experience with 
          choice screens. This means that we have sufficient experience to inform the elaboration of a 
          standard. And second, we can observe that the usage volume of a given browser or search engine 
          determines how much power that browser or search engine has over the structure of the web. This means 
          that there is an ethical necessity to make these volumes reflect user preferences.

            Definition of the process through which a browswer or search engine can become a candidate

          <h3>Normative Specifications</h3>
          <p>
            The Working Group will deliver the W3C normative specifications listed below. Note that because
            W3C is not (and should not be) in a position to preempt local regulations, these specifications 
            are intended to provide a sensible global baseline for choice processes. Local jurisdictions
            may tighten or loosen the constraints chosen by the group. However, our hope is to provide enough
            of a credible baseline that it is almost always adopted as is.

                This specification defines a choice screen for browsers. The choice screen displays a 
                set of browsers from which the user can choose. Each browser has some standardized information 
                listed, including possibly some labels drawn from the browser's registration and that 
                describe properties that people struggle to assess for themselves (e.g. privacy properties).
              </p>
              <p>
                The group may produce a reference implementation of this specification.

          each choice screen specification is expected to demonstrate its real-world viability. Because these

          Each specification should contain sections detailing all known security,

          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsWD" title="First Public Working Draft">FPWD</a>.  The
          Working Group is encouraged to engage collaboratively with the horizontal review groups throughout development of
          each specification.  The Working Group is advised to seek a review at least 3 months before first entering
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</a> and is encouraged
          to proactively notify the horizontal review groups when major changes occur in a specification following a review.

          Technical discussions for this Working Group are conducted in 
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>: the meeting minutes 
          from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions 
          and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. 
          Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed in public repositories and may permit 
          direct public contribution requests. The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.
          The Working Group may decide to record its meetings and to make the video publicly available.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, 
          and meetings) will be available from the <a href="#XXX">Choice Screen Working Group home page.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Most Choice Screen Working Group teleconferences will focus on discussion of particular specifications, 
          and will be conducted on an as-needed basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          This group primarily conducts its technical work <a class="todo" id="public-github" href="#XXX">GitHub issues</a>.
          The public is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this work.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion 
          of the Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant 
          requests such a discussion.

        <h2>Decision Policy</h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the 
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus">W3C Process Document (section 5.2.1, Consensus)</a>. 
          Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in 
          discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal 
          voting being required.
        </p>
        <p>
           However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful 
           consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a 
           decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including 
          publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered 
          provisional. A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via 
          email, GitHub issue or web-based survey), with a response period from 
          <span id='cfc'>one week to 10 working days</span>, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group 
          consensus on the issue. If no objections are raised by the end of the response period, the resolution 
          will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information 
          becomes available or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the 
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 5.2.3, Deciding by Vote)</a> 
          and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.
